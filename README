Requirements:
============

A  Sencha Touch 2.0.RC2 app using Ext.navigation.View to pop and push views, linked to a Node.js backend to provide data through a MongoDB database through URLs. The app is based on (Birmingham) Artsfest2011 as I developed a similar app using Sencha Touch 1 and wanted to do the same app in Sencha Touch 2. This is a basic app just for proof fof concept and not intended for production.
